## BHT Website Upgrade
This is a redo of my company’s website.  The original website was outdated and lacked important things such as responsive design, user-interactivity, user-friendly fonts, and accessibility.  The website also had a couple of dead links.  I have attempted to add some of these components for a better overall website while also enhancing the overall visual appeal of the website.

The website incorporated skills I learned in Code Louisville’s Front-End Web Development cohort.  I also used some python skills I had previously learned.

## Requirements
The website requires a web server that can serve Python files.  However, for easier viewing I am hosting the site [here](http://kenneth.pythonanywhere.com).
