        <p>Reliable test results that allow accurate comparability from test to test require dust with a consistent formulation. Blue Heaven dust is manfactured in strict accordance with ASHRAE specifications (52.1 and 52.2). Our process control and state-of-the-art blending equipment assure each batch is produced per spec and with the exact same formulation. Blue Heaven test technicians have 16 years of experience producing ASHRAE dust.</p>
