    <h2>Reliable Test Results Require Consistent Dust Formulation</h2>
    <p>Reliable test results that allow accurate comparability from test to test require dust with a consistent formulation.

Our process control and state-of-the-art blending equipment assure each batch is produced per spec and with the exact same formulation. Blue Heaven test technicians have 16 years of experience producing ASHRAE dust.</p>
